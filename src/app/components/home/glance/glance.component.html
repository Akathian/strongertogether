              Stronger Together was founded in October 2019 and continues to
              grow and build with the support of the community. Here at Stronger
              Together, we believe in creating a community in which no-one is
              left behind. We continuously try to raise awareness, provide
              motivation and support, and break down stigma. As you take a look
              around our website you will see the various services we offer,
              along with our blog posts, and the forum page to allow you to
              journal, connect, and discuss with one another. Our shop will be
              coming soon, and its primary goals will be to provide essentials
              that will help our well-being, and boost self-care - a portion of
              the proceeds will be donated to Centre for Addiction and Mental
              Health (CAMH).
