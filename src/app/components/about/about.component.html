            Stronger Together - a platform to spread awareness about mental
            health. With the goal of fostering a safe and supportive environment
            where individuals can openly share their experience, we aim to
            create a sense of community where no-one is left behind. The primary
            goal is to raise awareness, provide support and resources, and to
            share the message that you are not in this alone. By sharing lived
            experiences through photographs accompanied by stories that have
            been shared with us - some anonymous and others not, we hope to
            engage conversations within the community. Inspirational quotes will
            be shared to promote motivation and healing, along with educational
            posts on mental illness topics to create awareness.

              Hi everyone! My name is Saranya Jegatheeswaran, and I am an
              aspiring Nurse, and the founder of Stronger Together. As someone
              who has struggled greatly with my own mental health throughout my
              life, I aspire to make sure that others have the support and
              resources needed to access the care they need. My compassionate
              nature, interests in helping others, and passion for mental health
              awareness drove me to pursue a career in healthcare, coach people
              to attain the life they dream to live, and create a platform that
              seeks to raise mental health awareness. Stronger Together further
              reinforces this by providing individuals with a sense of community
              so that they don’t feel alone. My passion to help others, and
              create outstanding changes within the community and the world has
              led me to be an active mental health advocate and seek out
              opportunities in which I can help create a better future to live
              in. I believe in giving back, spreading love, creating awareness,
              and breaking stigma on important stigmatized and taboo topics.
