Can we have a register for an account pop up or something under this?


Peer Buddy Support (I know we spoke about doing an automatic generator to pair them, but I think I will do it manually instead)

Want to make a friend? Need some encouragement or peer support to help you? Remember, that signing up for this peer buddy support does not replace therapy. If you require professional support, please call crisis lines, your family physician, or other mental health resources (can be found in our extensive resources list on our blog). Please fill out the submission form below so that we can pair you with you buddy! Thank you, and you will hear from us about your peer buddy soon.

Submission Form: 
What’s your name?
I identify as (male, female, LGBTQQIP2SAA)... 
How old are you?
Specify preferences on who you’d like to speak to (we will try our best to meet preferences). 
How do you want to contact your peer buddy (phone, email, instagram, etc.)? Please leave your contact info.

A safe space where you can journal about your day, your problems, etc., in which people can reply providing emotional support, help, and guidance. Together, we can promote healing, hope, strength, resiliency, trust, and support.
Something like this - replacing that text with what is above. Keeping tabs All, and My posts. The other tabs/functions aren’t necessary.
